## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grayish-blue (#c0d9ec) to maintain the existing clinic website's calm and professional feel.
- Background color: Almost white (#f9fafb), very lightly tinted with the primary color, creating a clean backdrop for content.
- Accent color: Muted cerulean (#687782) provides subtle visual interest and guides the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Public Sans' (sans-serif) from the original design, as it ensures clarity and modernity.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different user roles and functions.
- Maintain a clean, well-spaced layout that is consistent across all interfaces to promote ease of use.
- Implement subtle animations, like fading transitions when switching between roles, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
